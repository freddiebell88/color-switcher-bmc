# Color Theory Guard

I've taken a simple React tutorial and given it a slight facelift for the 2024 Rehappening at Black Mountain College!
This project supplements the performance and installation "Color Theory Guard" presented by Swannatopia.

From the fine folks at Swannatopia: "“Color Theory Guard” will lead participant-viewers through a series of movements within a prismatic playground and color changing landscape. We would like to create a color wheel act that radiates out to the rest of the Rehappening. Every hour, we will introduce a new playground prop, color combination exercise, and “now” age ambient tracks that will slowly transform the space into a full spectrum experience. “Color Theory Guard'' will include an array of colorful banners/backdrops, projections, an interactive color wheel, shadow puppets, flags, pompoms, jump rope, sounds, prism mascot and a compact disc of ambient radiance to “bring the rainbow home”. Our guards will guide, dance, and improvise while exploring color relativity concepts, complementary and analogous relationships and monochromatic activities. Through dazzling live performance and edu-taining multimedia presentations, we, of Swannatopia’s Experimental Art Club, will create an immersive and unforgettable experience that leaves participant-viewers yearning for a more colorful realm and life cycle.
Influenced by: Josef Albers’ Interaction of Color, costume from Xanti Schawinski’s Spectodrama, Ani Albers’ Knots, CMYK vs RGBIV, Walk the Line and Hopscotch, Color guard and cheer squad routines, stage design as a medium, medium as message, Disney’s Fantasia, ribbon and square dancing, tambourines, “bells and whistles”, group exercise, playgrounds, flea circuses, crankys, the games “limbo” and “Twister”
Swannatopia Collective Statement and Bio:
Through a decade's worth of collaborative installations at ReHappening, we, of Swannatopia, have blurred the lines between viewer and participant within immersive, whimsical, thoughtful, experiences of empowerment.
“as we defamiliarize the familiar, we share the opportunity to dream together”
In the tradition of Black Mountain College, we believe artistic collaborations are essential to cultivate a healthy community and to maximize creative potential. We are a group of experimental artists living in and around Asheville who host a number of art shows each year in various venues. Our “Experimental Art Club” is a mutually supportive endeavor, and our practice and process are open, yet disciplined."

This project was built with Create React App

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

<!-- # Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
